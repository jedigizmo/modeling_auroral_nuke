This folder is a working directory for the research project:
Modeling Auroral Ionosphere - a Nuclear persepective

Advisors: COL Loucks, CDT Lauren Coleman '25
Researchers: CDT Catherine Brodsky '26, CDT Gikonyo Njendu '26

Current Status of project: Building own simulation with GEANT4 + Academic Reading

Status: Extract numerical data from model, fix compsition + energy, expand model
 
Create template for building simulations on pane user
Improve skills in C++ to build better code & understand physics behind the model
