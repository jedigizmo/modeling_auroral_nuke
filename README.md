This folder is a working directory for the research project:
Modeling Auroral Ionosphere - a Nuclear persepective

Advisors: COL Loucks, CDT Lauren Coleman '25
Researchers: CDT Catherine Brodsky '26, CDT Gikonyo Njendu '26

Current Status of project: Building own simulation with GEANT4 + Academic Reading

Status: Creating 1m^3 cube with atomic oxygen at certain density in order to shoot a single electron through ~ (fixing atmospheric composition to get right amount of oxygen + visibility) 
 
Create template for building simulations on pane user
find a way to pop out and run commands on terminal instead of little box in GUI
