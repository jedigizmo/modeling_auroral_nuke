# How to run a single example in GEANT4
This is a step by step description on how to compile and excute a single example within GEANT4.

### Prerequisites 
You make either start your own project or use an example provided by CERN (eg. A1, B1)
Ensure you have created a makefile, and used make to build and install the program.
Using make should give you an executable to run. 

### Running the example
Navigate to the directory with the executable, then execute the executable.
A small gui window should appear, where you can interact with the volume.

You should be able to rotate the volume 360&deg;.
The play button allows you to run an event and the command line within the GUI allows you to make modifications in realtime.

### Step by step for the PC in BH168
Open up the terminal

Navigate to /home/pane/modeling-auroral-nuke/GEANT4/geant4-v11.1.0/projects/cylinder/build/

Run this command "./testsim"

Press the green play button at the top of the GUI
