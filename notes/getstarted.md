# How to run a single example in GEANT4
This is a step by step description on how to compile and excute a single example within GEANT4.

### Prerequisites 
You make either start your own project or use an example provided by CERN (eg. A1, B1)
Ensure you have created a makefile, and used make to build and install the program.
Using make should give you an executable to run. 

### Running the example
Navigate to the directory with the executable, then execute the executable.
A small gui window should appear, where you can interact with the volume.
You should be able to rotate the volume 360&deg;.
