CMakeLists.txt is the file that CMake uses in order to build program
cmake_minumum_required is usuall going to be around 3.16 *per 2_3_2023

Geant4 seems to be an object oriented program similar to java
there is a UI component and a general run component to the program
"runManager->Initialize()" is the command that gives error messages

Initial thoughts on GEANT4:
	allows for complex simulations and a 3D view on particles
	Main gun that shoots particles, I think called "beamOn"
	allows one to create various shapes, shapes within shapes
	Can get material composition with "listMaterials"
