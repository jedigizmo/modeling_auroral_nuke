Research Plan - GANTT - resources, background, lauren old slides 
Abstract - 250 words - Motivation, Approach, Applications/progress, anticipated outcomes - draft 2/12
	"Novel Approach"
IPR1 - 10 weeks
IPR2 - 15 weeks
Final poster - TEE 
Space Science Conference - April
Projects Day - 5/4

Slide numbers, problem statement, Updated GANTT chart, m^3, Reasonable end state
Radar data - grabs electron velocities, etc, but has a very limited view
DASC - picture of the whole sky, but can use electron emissions to grab data
Model - Multiple electrons, varying in angle, get electrons to coil with magnetic fields

Working Meeting Discussion Points - 
SWW Schedule, How to print and bring board, Go for all days or just one day?

Use west point background
