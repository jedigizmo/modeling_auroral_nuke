if CMake Error in finding packages found, edit the CMakeLists.txt by adding the following command before if statement

set(Geant4_Dir "/home/pane/modeling-auroral-nuke/GEANT4/geant4-v11.1.0-install/lib/cmake/Geant4")

This commmand sets the "Geant4_DIR" to the source for the package config file so that CMake knows where to find it.

if there is an error while loading shared libraries like "libg4graphics-reps.so"

Then edit .bashrc file by appending "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/pane/modeling-auroral-nuke/GEANT4/geant4-v11.1.0-install/lib/"

This will set the environment variables so that GEANT4 will now know where to find the shared libraries.
